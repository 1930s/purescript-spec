# purescript-spec

purescript-spec is a simple testing framework for Purescript using NodeJS. It's
inspired by [hspec](http://hspec.github.io/).

## Usage

```bash
bower install purescript-spec
```

Then in a `Main.purs` file you can start writing your tests. Note that you
can use [QuickCheck](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-quickcheck)
seemlessly with `purescript-spec`. However, QuickCheck does it's own output
so reporting becomes a bit confusing. **This should be fixed soon.**

```purescript
module Main where

import Test.Spec (describe, pending, it)
import Test.Spec.Node
import Test.Spec.Assertions
import Test.QuickCheck

additionSpec =
  describe "Addition" do
    it "does addition" do
      (1 + 1) `shouldEqual` 2
    it "fails as well" do
      (1 + 1) `shouldEqual` 3

main = runNode do
  describe "Math" do
    additionSpec
    describe "Multiplication" do
      pending "will do multiplication in the future"
  describe "Tools" $
    describe "QuickCheck" $
      it "works too" $
        quickCheck \n -> n + 1 > n
```

In this example `additionSpec` is embedded into the `Math` specification. This
is useful if you want to split specifications into multiple files and combine
them in `Main`.

```purescript
main = suite do
  mathSpec
  stringsSpec
  arraySpec
  ...
```

Then run the test suite using `psc-make` and NodeJS. Not that `$TESTS`, `$SRC`
and `$LIB` contains all the Purescript source paths needed.

```bash
psc-make -o output/tests $TESTS $SRC $LIB
NODE_PATH=output/tests node -e "require('Main').main();"
```
